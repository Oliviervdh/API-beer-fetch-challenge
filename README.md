# API-beer-fetch-challenge

Api fetch challenge. The result came out like this: https://oliviervdh.github.io/API-beer-fetch-challenge/.

## Description

This project was build to learn how to fetch Json data and display it in a nice way on the web app.
We made this because it's part of our lessonplan.
I used fetch to get the data from the API and display it using a mapfunction on a literal template.

## Pending things to do
1. add sort function
2. add filter function
3. use await and async to fetch all beers in single page

Thanks for reading.
